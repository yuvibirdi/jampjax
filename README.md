# jampjax

The best most awesome game thing ever made!

## Playing the game
To play the game, you need to perform jumping jacks in front of your webcam. The game will detect your jumping jacks and you will recieve jacks in the game. You can use these jacks to buy upgrades.

When using auto-jacks, the game will automatically perform jumping jacks for you as long as you have energy in your energy bar at the bottom. To get energy, you need to perform either squats or high knees in front of your webcam. The game will detect these and give you energy.
